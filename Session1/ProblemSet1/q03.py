Catchphrases

Problem:
Write a function print_catchphrase() that accepts a string character
as a parameter and prints the catchphrase of the given character:

Pooh -> "Oh bother!"
Tigger -> "TTFN: Ta-ta for now!"
Eeyore -> "Thanks for noticing me."
Christopher Robin -> "Silly old bear."

If the given character does not match one of the characters above,
print "Sorry! I don't know <character>'s catchphrase!"

Sorry! I don't know Piglet's catchphrase!
